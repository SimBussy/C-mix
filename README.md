# C-mix

There a lot of things to do in order to improve the code : 

- Write a `README.md`, that explains what the model does and list the dependencies
- The dependencies can be automatically managed using pip
- All the *.pyc and __pycache__ folders must be removed from the repo, and we must add a .gitignore file
- We must code unittest to check that the code works properly
- This is a companion git repo for the paper, we'll put this code in the `MLPP` later :)
